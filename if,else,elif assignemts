Question:
Create a program for a restaurant that calculates the total cost of an order.

'''Assignment 7: Fitness App - BMI Calculator
Question:
Create a BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator that takes the user’s height and weight as input and calculates their BMI. Based on the BMI, provide feedback:
•⁠  ⁠BMI < 18.5: Underweight
•⁠  ⁠18.5 <= BMI < 24.9: Normal weight
•⁠  ⁠25 <= BMI < 29.9: Overweight
•⁠  ⁠BMI >= 30: Obesity'''

'''Assignment 9: Utility Bill Calculator
Question:
Design a utility bill calculator for a power company. The pricing is based on usage:
•⁠  ⁠If the usage is less than 100 units, the charge is $0.5 per unit.
•⁠  ⁠If the usage is between 100 and 300 units, the charge is $0.75 per unit.
•⁠  ⁠If the usage is above 300 units, the charge is $1 per unit.'''
